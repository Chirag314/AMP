## Readme File for Parkinson's Disease Progression Prediction

Project Overview:

    This project aims to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) using clinical data and a baseline approach. It calculates median values for target variables based on visit month and uses them as predictions for both training and test sets.

Key Steps:

Data Loading and Exploration:

    Loads clinical and supplemental clinical data from CSV files.
    Provides information about the shape, memory usage, patient count, and mean visit count of the datasets.
Evaluation Metric:

    Defines a function to calculate the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) for evaluating predictions.
Baseline Predictions:

    Calculates median values for target variables (UPDRS scores) based on visit month.
    Uses these medians as predictions for both training and validation sets.
    Reports SMAPE scores for each target variable and a global SMAPE score.
    Test Set Predictions:

Iterates through test sets provided by the 'amp_pd_peptide' environment.
    Extracts prediction IDs, patient IDs, visit months, and UPDRS scores from prediction IDs.
    Maps baseline predictions to test set predictions based on visit month.
    Handles missing predictions by finding the closest available baseline prediction.
    Submits final predictions using the 'env.predict' function.
Dependencies:

    pandas
    numpy
    amp_pd_peptide (custom environment, likely specific to a Kaggle competition)
Further Exploration:

Experiment with more sophisticated prediction models beyond baselines.
Consider feature engineering to extract more informative features from the data.
Explore different evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
Investigate techniques to handle missing values more effectively.
